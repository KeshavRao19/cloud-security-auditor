# AI-Powered Cloud Security Auditor

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Cloud Security Auditor** is an intelligent solution that automates the detection of misconfigurations in AWS cloud environments. It leverages AI to provide clear, human-readable explanations of security risks and suggests actionable fixes. The system connects to AWS using `boto3`, scans resources such as S3, IAM, and EC2 for vulnerabilities, stores the results in a database, processes them through an AI model, and displays findings in a user-friendly React dashboard. High-risk findings trigger alerts via email or Slack.

## Features
- **AWS Misconfiguration Scanning**: Identify issues in S3 buckets, IAM policies, and EC2 security groups.
- **AI-Driven Explanations & Fixes**: Converts technical findings into simple, actionable insights.
- **Centralized Storage**: All findings are securely stored for auditing and trend analysis.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of misconfigurations with severity filters.
- **Alerting System**: Sends instant notifications for critical vulnerabilities through email and Slack.
- **Scalable & Modular Design**: Easily extendable to support other cloud providers.

## Architecture
The solution consists of:
1. **AWS Scanner**: Uses `boto3` to fetch configurations from AWS services.
2. **Database Layer**: Stores raw and processed security findings.
3. **AI Processing Engine**: Generates explanations and remediation steps.
4. **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based UI for visualizing findings.
5. **Alerting System**: Logic for Slack and email notifications.
